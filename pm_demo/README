OVERVIEW
--------
The scripts cycle the system through different PM low power states which work
together with the web based system monitor application to form a out-of-box
demo for PM features.

USER GUIDE
----------
Please setup web based system monitor application first.
Then run ./pm_demo.sh.

The script will cycle the system through different PM low power states like
CPUidle, CPUfreq, CPU hotplug and so on. The demo is splited into two parts:
static PM features and dynamic PM features.

From web based monitor the real-time result is showing up. You can check the
current PM state from the output of the script.

The demo could be terminated by CTRL-C. It will apply the default PM features
back.
