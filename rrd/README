OVERVIEW
--------
This directory contains shell and cgi scripts which maintain a
database of sensor data and generate web pages containing
graphs of sensor data.

The RRD (Round Robin Database) package is REQUIRED.
Get this package from
         http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/

A web server with CGI support is required.

We have provided these scripts because the RRD package,
while simple to build and install, is rather difficult
to configure to store and display data.

RRD, together with lm_sensors and these scripts, provide the
following advantages:
	- True round-robin (constant-size) database
	- On-the-fly graph generation with CGI scripts
	- Multiple data views using single database
	- Automatic time stamping, interpolation of missing data,
	  large data dropouts (during machine downtime) correctly
	  shown on graphs

The RRD scripts read /sys entries and do not use libsensors.
Therefore the scale factors in /etc/sensors.conf are not used,
and you may have to change the scale factors in the cgi scripts.


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------
	- make sure the web server is working.
	- setup the right system time.
	- enter /usr/rrd directory and run 'make' (as root).
	- Load http://ip.address/senspix/sensors.cgi in your web
	  browser to view the monitor results.


RECONFIG INSTRUCTIONS
---------------------
Before reconfig your monitor system please make sure the system is
running properly.
	- modify (remove/add/resort) monitor.conf file as you wish.
	- run 'make config'.
